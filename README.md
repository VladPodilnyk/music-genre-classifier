### Music genre classifier using DL

The project showcases an example of audio processing using computer vision. In particular it uses a family of image recognition neural networks
to identify patterns/features of a [MEL spectrogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum) and use this "knowledge" to derive a music genre of a song.

The repo contains a notebook that shows the process of data exploration and model training, together
with a small script featuring [Gradio app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/podil97/music_genre_classifier) build on top of the trained model.
